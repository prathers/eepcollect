Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the extension with the extension manager. Include the static template 'PageCollector Default (eepcollect)' into your StaticTemplate record (see the selectorbox  'Include static (from extensions):' and choose this extension). You will then have a range of predefined TypoScript-Setup variables for this extension, which you can change and customise as you like.

You can also use Constant Editor (PAGECOLLECTOR) to manage some of these typoscript configurations.

To see the plugin in Frontend, you have to define a contentelement with the type 'insert plugin',  where you select the plugin to insert. Then you will get a “view plugin option”. You just have to choose the viewmode. Start with 'toolbar' to get a quick impression.
