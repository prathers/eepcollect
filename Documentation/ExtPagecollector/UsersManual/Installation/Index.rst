Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Install the extension with the Extension Manager. Include the static
template 'PageCollector Default (eepcollect)' into your StaticTemplate
record (see the selectorbox 'Include static (from extensions):' and
select the extension). You'll have a range of predefined
TypoScript setup variables for the extension, which you can change and
customise, as you like.

You can also use Constant Editor (PAGECOLLECTOR) to manage some of
the TypoScript configurations.

To see the plugin in Frontend, you need to define a Plugin content element. To get a quick impression, try the 'toolbar' in the Plugin setting. Save and hit the View page.
