What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pagecollector is a Frontend tool that gives visitors the
possibility to choose among predefined TYPO3 pages and add them to
their own favorite list of pages. The list works a bit like ab webshop basket.
Visitors can always maintain his favorite pages, back in time. Basicly
the idea is to provide pages and exercises for students, where teachers can
collect and print a selection of given themes. When collecting is finihed, the teacher go to the basket pages, where the content of preselected
pages will be listed in predefined order. A printable version with
cover sheet, including structure of content and a pagebreak between all
collected pages and their content, is the result of this
extension.

You could use it to let visitors create their own menus, by
using HMENU(myMenu.special.list.data = global:HTTP\_COOKIE\_VARS \|
tx\_eepcollect\_pi1).
