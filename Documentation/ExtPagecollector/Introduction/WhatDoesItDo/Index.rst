What does it do?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pagecollector is a pure Frontendtool that give visitors the
possibility to choose some predefined TYPO3 pages for adding them to
their own favorit-list like products in a basket from a webshop.
Visitors can always obtain his favorite content, back in time. Basicly
the idea was to provide exercises for scholars where teachers can
collect and printout a favour selection of given themes. At least, it
is possible to get one page, where the content of all preselected
pages will be listed in predefined sorting. A printable version with
cover sheet including structure of content and a pagebreak between all
collected different pages and theirs content is the result of these
extension.

You could use it to let create visitors theirs own menues, by using by
using HMENU(myMenu.special.list.data = global:HTTP\_COOKIE\_VARS \|
tx\_eepcollect\_pi1).
