Introduction
------------

Visitors can collect pages and add them to their own favorit-list like a basket in a shop.

Including delete and sort functions.

Using cookies or fe_users accounts.

A lot TYPO3 users apply this extension as a small ordering function and asking me for further solutions or help, such as combination with powermail, ajax functionalities, etc.
It would be nice, if other users could enjoy your benefits – be inspired to share.
